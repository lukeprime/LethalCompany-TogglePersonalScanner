# TogglePersonalScanner
- When the scan button is single clicked, scanning will be toggled on and will run constantly.  Single click again and it will toggle off.
- The scanning visual effect and sound effect do not play when scan toggle is turned on so that it is not too distracting during gameplay.
- You can still hold to scan if preferred, but this action will turn off the scan toggle.  Holding scan will play the scanning visual effect and sound effect *(useful when you have no flashlight)*.
- When scan toggle is enabled, automatic scanning only works outside of the ship. When inside the ship the scan button works like vanilla.
- Turn off scan toggle when ship is leaving, or player has died, or round has ended.
- Inspired by Hold Scan Button by FutureSavior and Toggle Scan by UnscriptedLogic. Originally forked from Hold Scan Button with my own enhancements as well as a variation of UnscriptedLogic's mod.
