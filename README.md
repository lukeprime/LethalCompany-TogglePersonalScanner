# TogglePersonalScanner
- When the scan button is single-clicked, scanning will be toggled on and will run constantly. Single-click again, and it will toggle off.
- A scanner icon is shown in the HUD when automatic scanning is toggled on.
- The scanning visual effect and sound effect do not play when the scan toggle is turned on, so it is not too distracting during gameplay.
- You can still hold to scan if preferred, but this action will toggle off automatic scanning. Holding scan will play the scanning visual effect and sound effect *(useful when you have no flashlight)*.
- When scanning is toggled on, automatic scanning only works outside of the ship. When inside the ship, the scan button works like vanilla.
- The scan toggle gets reset automatically when the ship is leaving, the player has died, or the round has ended.
- Inspired by the Hold Scan Button by FutureSavior and Toggle Scan by UnscriptedLogic. Originally forked from Hold Scan Button with my own enhancements as well as a variation of UnscriptedLogic's mod.
